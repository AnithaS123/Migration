Step 1: Clarifying the Problem Scope
Assumptions and basic system requirements:

Cashless payments: The machine supports cashless payment methods like credit cards, mobile wallets, or NFC-based payments (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay).
Multiple candy options: The machine offers different types of candy.
Inventory management: The system tracks the stock of candy in real-time.
User interface: A display screen for users to select the type of candy, make payments, and view instructions.
Connectivity: The machine is connected to a cloud server for real-time updates, such as payment processing, inventory monitoring, and alerts.
Fault tolerance: The system should handle hardware issues like candy jams and ensure failover for payment processes.

Step 2: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements:

1.	Cashless payment processing: Users can select candy and pay using credit/debit cards, NFC-enabled devices, or mobile wallets.
2.	Inventory tracking: The system updates the stock level of each candy type and alerts for refilling when needed.
3.	User interaction: A user-friendly interface allows users to select candy and process payments.
4.	Candy dispensing: Once payment is successful, the machine dispenses the selected candy.
5.	Payment confirmation: A receipt (digital or printed) is provided to users for each transaction.
6.	Admin access: Operators can check the stock remotely, manage transactions, and perform maintenance tasks.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1.	Security: Payment information must be handled securely (PCI DSS compliance).
2.	Low latency: The entire transaction, from selection to candy dispensing, should complete in a few seconds.
3.	Scalability: The system should scale across multiple machines, tracking inventory and payments in real-time.
4.	Fault tolerance: Handle errors gracefully, such as payment failures or candy dispensing issues.
5.	Reliability: Ensure that the machine operates smoothly under various conditions (network failure, power outages, etc.).

Step 3: System Components and High-Level Architecture

1. Hardware Components

•	Candy storage bins: Separate containers for each type of candy.
•	Dispensing mechanism: A motorized mechanism that dispenses candy when the transaction is successful.
•	Card reader/NFC module: For processing cashless payments through credit/debit cards or mobile wallets.
•	Touchscreen display: For user interaction, allowing candy selection, payment processing, and displaying instructions.
•	Microcontroller: Embedded system to handle real-time operations (candy dispensing, interacting with the display, and managing local processes).
•	Sensors: To detect if the candy has been dispensed successfully.
•	Connectivity module: Wi-Fi or 4G/5G connectivity to communicate with the cloud for payments and inventory management.

2. Software Components

•	User Interface (UI): The frontend interface on the touchscreen that allows the user to select candy, make payments, and receive feedback.
•	Payment Gateway: Integration with a payment processor to handle card and mobile wallet payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or Square).
•	Candy Dispensing Controller: Software running on the microcontroller that controls the motor and dispensing mechanism, ensuring the correct candy is dispensed.
•	Inventory Management: Tracks the amount of candy left in each bin and updates the backend when stocks are running low.
•	Backend Server: Manages payments, logs transactions, and handles inventory updates across multiple machines. This component may also push firmware updates and health checks.
•	Admin Dashboard: A web-based interface for operators to monitor stock levels, transaction logs, and machine status in real-time.

3. Cloud and Network Components

•	Cloud Database: Stores transaction logs, inventory status, and machine health data. The database should be highly available and scalable (e.g., using a NoSQL document store or relational database).
•	API Gateway: Handles communication between the vending machines and backend services (payment processor, inventory updates).
•	Message Queue: For asynchronous tasks like sending payment confirmation, updating inventory levels, and triggering stock refill alerts.
•	Monitoring and Alerting: Services like Prometheus or Grafana for monitoring machine health, connection status, and inventory levels, sending alerts to operators when necessary.

Step 4: Workflow and Interaction Diagram

1.	User Interaction and Payment Flow: The user approaches the machine, selects the candy from the touchscreen. The user is prompted to pay via card or mobile wallet. The payment is processed through the card reader/NFC module. The machine sends the payment data to the Payment Gateway via the Cloud API. Once payment is confirmed, the backend notifies the machine to dispense the candy. Candy is dispensed, and the stock is updated in the cloud database.
2.	Inventory and Admin Monitoring: The machine continuously tracks candy levels with sensors. The stock levels are periodically pushed to the cloud, where operators can view inventory status. Low stock triggers a refill alert on the admin dashboard.
3.	Handling Failures: Payment failure: If the payment fails, the user is notified to retry. Dispensing failure: If the candy is not dispensed correctly, the machine detects the failure (using sensors) and retries the operation or refunds the transaction.

Step 5: Data Flows and Storage Requirements

1.	Transaction Logs Each transaction will generate:

•	Transaction ID
•	Candy selected
•	User payment info (tokenized and secure)
•	Payment status (success/failure)
•	Time of transaction
Storage estimate: For each transaction (roughly 200 bytes), assuming 1,000 transactions per day, we’ll need ~200 KB per day for logs. Over one year, this adds up to ~73 MB, which is minimal in modern cloud storage.

2. Inventory Data

•	Each machine tracks stock levels for each candy bin. For example, 10 candy types, each with a count between 0-100.
•	Updates occur after each transaction and daily for regular reporting.
Storage estimate: Minimal, as we only track the stock counts across machines (~1 KB per machine).

Step 6: Database Choices

For managing transactions, stock levels, and machine health:
1.	NoSQL Document Store (Preferred): A NoSQL store like MongoDB or DynamoDB would handle the hierarchical data structure (transaction logs, inventory per machine, etc.).Why: NoSQL stores are more scalable for real-time updates, and they allow easy replication across regions if multiple machines are deployed. Why not other choices: Relational databases may not handle the real-time updates and distributed nature of vending machines as efficiently.
2.	Relational Database: Could be used for managing users, operators, and machine metadata, but less suitable for frequent real-time updates from distributed machines.
1.	Why choose: Useful if the system has relationships that are highly transactional.
2.	Why not preferred: Scaling across multiple machines and real-time updates makes NoSQL a better fit.

Step 7: Optimizing Performance and Handling Bottlenecks

•	Local Caching: Use caching (e.g., Redis) for transaction processing to reduce latency in high-traffic locations.
•	Optimized Payment Processing: Choose a payment gateway with minimal latency, and batch smaller transactions to reduce API calls.
•	Retry Logic: Implement retry mechanisms for both payment failures and dispensing failures.

Step 8: Fault Tolerance and Redundancy

•	Local Backup of Transactions: If the machine loses connectivity, it can store transactions locally and sync with the cloud once reconnected.
•	Hardware Redundancy: Use sensors to detect mechanical failures, with the ability to retry dispensing or notify the user of an issue.
•	Cloud Failover: Ensure the backend services and databases are replicated across regions for high availability.
